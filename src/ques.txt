Practice Questions


Q1. Create a class Car having properties manufacturer and price. Create three instances of the class and display the details of each car sorted with respect to the price.

Q2. Design a class Room that has properties AC_ON, HOME_THEATRE_ON, FAN_ON and LIGHT_ON that stores Boolean values to indicate whether the appliance is ON or OFF. Design a menu driven program in java that puts ON/OFF the corresponding appliances and gives appropriate message. If the total power consumed is more than 2kW, show a message Overload. Assume AC consumes 1200 watts, Home Theatre consumes 600 watts, Fan consumes 400 watts and light consumes 100 watt.

Q3. Design a java program to display the number of instances created so far of a specific class.

Q4. Design an application in java that contains a class Student having properties name and percentage. Create a class Test that declares three instances of Student class. The values are passed through constructor at the time of its object creation. The output should be the name and percentage of the topper.

Q5. Create a class 'Student' with three data members which are name, age and address. The constructor of the class assigns default values name as "unknown", age as '0' and address as "not available". It has two member methods with the same name “setInfo”. First method has two parameters for name and age and assigns the same whereas the second method takes three parameters which are assigned to name, age and address respectively. Print the name, age and address of 10 students.

Q6. Suppose you have a Piggie Bank with an initial amount of 50 and you have to add some more amount to it. Create a class 'AddAmount' with a data member named 'amount' with an initial value of 50. Now make two constructors of this class as follows:
1 - without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Piggie Bank
2 - having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to Piggie Bank
Create object of the 'AddAmount' class and display the final amount in Piggie Bank.

Q7. Create a class named 'Programming'. While creating an object of the class, if nothing is passed to it, then the message "I love programming languages" should be printed. If some String is passed to it, then in place of "programming languages" the name of that String variable should be printed.
For example, while creating object if we pass "Java", then "I love Java" should be printed.

Q8. Create a new class called Calculator with the following methods:
1. A static method called powerInt(int num1,int num2)
This method should return num1 to the power num2.
2. A static method called powerDouble(double num1,int num2).
This method should return num1 to the power num2.
3. Invoke both the methods and test the functionalities.
Hint: Use Math.pow(double,double) to calculate the power.

Q9. Create class Number with only one private instance variable as a int primitive type. Initialize it with parameterised constructor and include the following methods  isZero( ), isPositive(), isNegative( ), isOdd( ), isEven( ), isPrime(), isAmstrong()
the above methods return boolean primitive type value.
getFactorial(), getSqrt(), getSqr(), sumDigits()  these methods return int primitive type value.
dispBinary(), dispOctal(), displayhexa() these method return string value

Q10. Create an int array of size 5, initialize it with values(10,20,30,40,50). Create a public boolean search(int arr[], int search_element) this method will return true if the search element is present in the array else it will  print a message "element not found"
